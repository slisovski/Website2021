&lt;p&gt;You can downlaod wind (horizontal) u und (vertical) v vectors on a global scale for different pressure levels (altitudes) from the ERA-5 dataset.
Batch download requests can be done with python code that can be run via RStudio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, you need to create an account with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ecmwf.int/&#34;&gt;ECWMF&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, you need to have some kind of Python compiler installed on you pc/mac. See &lt;a href=&#34;https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/&#34; class=&#34;uri&#34;&gt;https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/&lt;/a&gt; for explanations. This link may also help to get the minimum required python stuff installed (&lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html&#34; class=&#34;uri&#34;&gt;https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You need to following packages:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;library(reticulate)
library(glue)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Set your Python environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;use_virtualenv(&amp;quot;~/Documents/Virtualenv&amp;quot;, required = TRUE) ## here, I have installed python 3&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;test&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Test&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a test, downlad the global wind dataset for a specific day and two specific pressure levels:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Tutorial (all detailes will follow shortly)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently submitted a simulation of migrating Bar-tailed godwits (&lt;em&gt;Limosa lapponica&lt;/em&gt;) to a vizualisation competition initiated by the &lt;a href=&#34;https://besmovesig.wordpress.com/&#34;&gt;BES Movement Ecology SIG&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/S_Lisovski/status/1361039948892286979&#34;&gt;animation&lt;/a&gt; shows the epic migration of Bar-tailed godwits from New Zealand to Alaska via the Yellow Sea during northward migration, and the amazing non-stop flight from Alaska to New Zealand (or in some cases via Australia or the southern Pacific Islands) during southward migration.In addition, the animation puts the individual migration tracks in relation to wind (from ECWMF ERA5 dataset) and snow cover (NOAA IMS Northern Hemisphere Daily Snow Cover dataset). On the globe, you see the wind speed over the ocean (median wind speed across 10m, 750p, 800p and 925p) and simulated particle tracks drifting with the wind. The individials circles change size and color according to the wind support during movements (no movement indicated with grey circles). The green inland color shows the topography (based on NOAA ETOPO2v2). On the right panel, you see the distribution of wind support across all individuals separated by the major fligth bouts (legs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Jesse Conklin and Phil Battley for sharing the tracks and for valuable input and discussion sourrounding the migration of this species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this tutorial, I will describe the main steps and processes to project tracks on the 3D surface of the earth, include wind fields and render the scene using &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/tylermorganwall/rayshader&#34;&gt;rayshader&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Light‐Level Geolocator Analyses: A user&#39;s guide</title>
      <link>https://slisovski.rbind.io/post/geolocationuserguide/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 11 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://slisovski.rbind.io/post/geolocationuserguide/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Established in 1987, the ARGOS system allowed the world-wide tracking of animals equipped with satellite transmitters. This new technology provided unprecedented insights into the movements of animals. But the devices were bulky as well as heavy and not yet ready to track the majority of smaller species like birds. In search for alternatives, the biologist Rory Wilson recalled that early voyagers did not have on-board GPS, nor satellite transmitters to ascertain their position (1). Instead, they observed the sun`s trajectory to estimate their whereabouts, using the day length to derive latitude and the exact time of noon to estimate longitude. He concluded that a simple light sensor, which requires far less power than a satellite transmitter, may provide reliable information about seabird movements across the annual cycle. After designing tags that consisted of a light sensor, a clock, a memory chip, and a lithium battery, he first deployed these tags on wandering albatrosses and Magellanic penguins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then, geolocation by light has come a long way and is currently one of the most frequently used tracking technologies in bird migration research. A real boost in the number of applications happened after Bridget Stutchbury and her team deployed 1.5g geolocators developed by the British Antarctic Survey on different songbird species in 2008 (2). Recently, Migrate Technology Ltd. developed a 0.32g logger that successfully recorded a 13.000km migration route of 10g Willow warblers from Far East Russia to East Africa (3).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;./Fig1.png&#34; alt=&#34;png&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center; font-style: italic;&#34;&gt;Figure 1: One of the first light-level geolocators deployed on an animal, a Magellanic penguin, to track its movement. The tag was developed, built and deployed by Rory Wilson, despite huge amount of flack for this approach criticising that this method was only good for revealing movement on an ocean basin scale. One of the most recent developed tag weights only 0.35 g (from Migrate Technology Ltd.) and was used to track a 10 g Willow warbler (right). Image credits: Rory Wilson (left, centre), Harald Ris (right).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there was not only the need to build smaller and smaller tags, but to develop tools and methods that produce scientifically sound and reproducible tracks from light intensity recordings. The major downside of this technology is arguable the low accuracy compared to satellite mediated locations that results from the fact that light almost never hits the sensor of the logger without some level of shading. And even worse, the very same amount of shading has a very different effect on the accuracy depending on the time of the year and the actual location of the logger on the globe. Thus, researcher regularly struggled in the analysis and interpretation of the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2011 the Swiss Ornithological Institute organised a first international workshop, at a beautiful site in the Alps, to discuss methods and potential developments of open source tools for the analysis of geolocator data. The National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis funded another meeting in 2013 taking place in Santa Barbara, California. Stimulated or improved by these meetings, various R packages and other open source tools emerged that allow users to apply different theories and use additional information to improve the accuracy and precision of location estimates based on light recordings.
In our &amp;lsquo;HOW TO&amp;hellip;&amp;rsquo; paper that is part of the special issue on biologging in Journal of Animal Ecology (Lisovski et al. 2020) we now provide an overview of the different tools that may help in choosing an appropriate analysis method. Furthermore, we give advice on how to interpret and report results and introduce a comprehensive online manual that applies the concepts to several datasets, demonstrates the use of open‐source analysis tools with step‐by‐step instructions and code and details our recommendations for interpreting, reporting and archiving &lt;a href=&#34;https://geolocationmanual.vogelwarte.ch/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And even though satellite tags are becoming smaller and smaller too, allowing to track small birds with high accuracy, we consider our efforts to be of value to the research community for the years to come. In addition to the relatively low costs, several recent technological advancements will perhaps even increase the appeal of light level geolocators. The most important among them is probably the combination of light recording with other en-route data, such as air pressure, acceleration, magnetism and temperature. These additional data can facilitate the refinement of location estimates. For instance, acceleration data or changes in air pressure can distinguish movement and residency periods relatively easily, and such prior knowledge can then be fed into the stationary location estimation. These additional sensor data also provide a wealth of complementary information on fine‐scale behaviour: air pressure and temperature can be used to infer flight altitude and initiation and termination of migratory or foraging flights; acceleration data can be used to determine daily activity budgets and, given supplementary measurements, be related to energy expenditure and energy budgets; magnetic field data can be used to infer strategies in orientation and navigation during migration. Combining such behavioural information with refined, reliable and accurate location estimates can assist in identifying habitat associations of migrants or their responses to evolutionarily novel factors such as artificial light at night, sensory pollution or wind farms. This knowledge will improve our understanding of the fates of migrants and the bottlenecks they might experience at sensitive times and places, which will allow us to improve our conservation and management strategies for migratory populations.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mitigating conflicts between agriculture and migratory geese: is shooting a viable option or just passing on the problem?</title>
      <link>https://slisovski.rbind.io/post/huntingmodel/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 31 May 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://slisovski.rbind.io/post/huntingmodel/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Following the recent article, Shooting may aggravate rather than alleviate conflicts between migratory geese and agriculture, Silke Bauer explains why management plans for migratory goose populations need to be considered across a broader scale.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A challenge with developing management plans for migratory populations is that these populations use several sites in their annual cycle. Therefore, local actions may not only affect how migratory animals behave and forage locally, but also when they move to another site, and how they behave and forage when there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike many other migratory species, most migratory goose populations have thrived in recent decades and massively increased their abundances. One reason behind these increases is probably their switch to agricultural food, which is abundantly available over long periods in the year. However, this use of agricultural resources frequently leads to conflicts with farmers. Control and management measures are therefore called for that have the shared objective of reducing these conflicts but still maintaining migratory populations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;./huntinggif2.gif&#34; alt=&#34;gif&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center; font-style: italic;&#34;&gt;Figure 1: Model predictions for the migration of White-fronted geese in the default case (left panel), with predation risk increased by a factor of 10 (middle panel) or 100 (right panel).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Geese are interacting with humans on various sites along the flyway. In the wintering area, they are left undisturbed or are increasingly shot for management purposes, while on most migratory sites geese are a quarry species. For example, in Russia geese are hunted mainly during spring migration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We used a theoretical approach – a behaviour-based migration model – to assess the consequences of derogation shooting, hunting and scaring on the migration behaviour and demographic rates of geese, and how these accumulate in agricultural damage. We applied this model to the Baltic-North Sea population of white-fronted geese (Anser albifrons), which has increased from 10,000-50,000 in the 1950s to 1,200,000 around 2010, raising serious conflicts with agriculture, particularly in the Netherlands where the majority of these geese overwinter. We were particularly interested in whether such actions would alleviate conflicts with agriculture or pass on the problem to other sites. We ran scenarios with shooting/hunting being installed at single or multiple locations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;./geese-helmut-kruckenberg.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;jpg&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center; font-style: italic;&#34;&gt;Figure 2: White-fronted geese. © Helmut Kruckenberg&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found that hunting, shooting and scaring can result in a suite of direct and indirect consequences on migration and foraging behaviour – from less intense foraging and later migratory departure, to avoiding sites. Most importantly, changing conditions on a particular site, be it through management or natural processes, not only alters the behaviour of migrants immediately and locally, but could also do so at a later time and at a distance. Furthermore, the specific consequences of shooting/hunting could be counter-intuitive, i.e. aggravate rather than alleviate agricultural damage, depending on where along the migration route changes had taken place and the mechanisms through which hunting/shooting was assumed to affect geese. This means that although local management actions can be effective locally, i.e. chase geese away or force them to migrate earlier, these might pass on the problem to sites further down the flyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While our modelling approach made several simplifying assumptions and can only be a first step in developing an adaptive management plan, our results do underline that management plans for migratory geese should be formulated and evaluated on a flyway level.&lt;/p&gt;
