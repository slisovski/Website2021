Although often attributed to phenotypic plasticity, there is no clear demonstration of long-term population advancement in avian migration through individual plasticity. Using direct observations of bar-tailed godwits (Limosa lapponica) departing New Zealand on a 16,000-km journey to Alaska, we show that migration advanced by six days during 2008–2020, and that within-individual advancement was sufficient to explain this population-level change. However, in individuals tracked for the entire migration (50 total tracks of 36 individuals), earlier departure did not lead to earlier arrival or breeding in Alaska, due to prolonged stopovers in Asia. Moreover, changes in breeding-site phenology varied across Alaska, but were not reflected in within-population differences in advancement of migratory departure. We demonstrate that plastic responses can drive population-level changes in timing of long-distance migration, but also that behavioral and environmental constraints en route may yet limit adaptive responses to global change.","tags":["Migration","Phenology","Global change","Seasonal change"],"title":"Advancement in long-distance bird migration through individual plasticity in departure","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Joanna B Wong","Simeon Lisovski","Ray T Alisauskas","Willow English","Marie-Andrée Giroux","Autumn-Lynn Harrison","Dana Kellett","Nicolas Lecomte","Mark Maftey","Avery Nagy-MacArthur","Robert A Ronconi","Paul A Smith","Mark L Mallory","Marie Auger-Méthé"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1628121600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1628121600,"objectID":"6f75bdc1928e773bf1f273454cfe4987","permalink":"https://slisovski.rbind.io/publication/journal-article/wong_et_al_2021-meps/","publishdate":"2021-08-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/journal-article/wong_et_al_2021-meps/","section":"publication","summary":"The Arctic tern is an iconic seabird, famous for its annual migrations between the Arctic and the Antarctic. Its wide geographical range has impeded knowledge of potential population bottlenecks during its annual bi-hemispheric movements. Although Arctic terns breed in the Pacific, Atlantic, and Arctic coasts of North America, few tracking studies have been conducted on North American Arctic terns, and none in Canada, which represents a significant proportion of their circumpolar breeding range. Using light-level geolocators, we tracked 53 Arctic terns from 5 breeding colonies across a wide latitudinal and longitudinal range within North America. We compared the routes taken by birds in our study and migration timing to those previously tracked from Greenland, Iceland, The Netherlands, Sweden, Norway, Maine (USA), and S. Alaska (USA). Most Arctic terns tracked globally used one of 3 southbound migration routes: (1) Atlantic West Africa; (2) Atlantic Brazil; and (3) Pacific coastal, and one of 2 northbound migration routes: (1) Mid-ocean Atlantic and (2) Mid-ocean Pacific. Some other trans-equatorial seabirds also used these migration routes, suggesting that Arctic tern routes may be important for other species. The migration timing for southbound and northbound migrations was generally different between tracked tern colonies worldwide but generally fell within a 1-2 mo window. Our research suggests that conservation management of Arctic terns during their migration should dynamically adapt with the times of the year that terns use parts of their route. Future identification of common multi-species seabird flyways could aid the international negotiations required to conserve pelagic seabirds such as Arctic terns.","tags":["Migration","Conservation","Arctic terns"],"title":"Arctic terns from circumpolar breeding colonies share common migratory routes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kayleigh A.

The drivers of sexual segregation, such as sex differences in body size, breeding constraints, and social behaviour, have been well studied in adults but are poorly understood in immature animals. To determine whether sexual segregation occurs in juvenile Antarctic fur seals, Arctocephalus gazella, and investigate the underlying drivers, we deployed Global Location Sensors on 26 males and 19 females of 1–3 years of age at Bird Island, South Georgia. Sexual segregation occurred in foraging distribution, primarily in latitude, with females foraging closer to South Georgia and the Polar Front, and males foraging further south near the Antarctic Peninsula. This segregation was particularly evident in Feb–Apr and May–Nov, and males spent more time hauled out than females in May–Nov. Although juveniles have no immediate reproductive commitments, reproductive selection pressures are still likely to operate and drive sex differences in body size, risk-taking, and social roles. These factors, coupled with prey distribution, likely contributed to sexual segregation in juvenile Antarctic fur seals. Consequently, male and female juveniles may compete with different fisheries and respond differently to environmental change, highlighting the importance of considering sex and age groups in species conservation efforts.","tags":["Migration","Macroecology"],"title":"Sexual segregation in juvenile Antarctic fur seals","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Simeon Lisovski"],"categories":[],"content":" Editors’ Choice article: Lisovski, S., Neumann, R., Albrecht, T., Munclinger, P., Ahola, M.P., Bauer, S., Cepak, J., Fransson, T., Jakobsson, S., Jaakkonen, T., Klvana, P., Kullberg, C., Laaksonen, T., Metzger, B., Piha, M., Shurulinkov, P., Stach, R., Ström, K., Velmala, W. and Briedis, M. (2021), The Indo-European flyway: Opportunities and constraints reflected by Common Rosefinches breeding across Europe. J Biogeogr. 48:1255–1266. https://doi.org/10.1111/jbi.14085\n To me, the common rosefinch is still a rather exotic bird species. In the last decades the bird with its iconic song that is often rendered as “pleased to meet you” (check it out yourself), has expanded its huge breeding range westwards, and we have seen small populations emerging at new sites in Europe. During my undergraduate studies, my friend and co-author Roland Neumann was investigating a population at the Baltic Sea Coast. Since very little was known about their routes and their destinations, he was catching and banding individuals with the hope to get resightings from their wintering sites or from any location during their migratory journey. Unfortunately, the massive efforts didn’t pay off.\nWe were thus super excited that, in collaboration with the Swiss Ornithological Institute and co-funded by the German Ornithologists’ Society, we could deploy light-level geolocators on male rosefinches in 2011. These devices were still somewhat new in the sense that they have just gotten small enough to use on a 25g bird such as the common rosefinch. Those so called geolocators record light intensity that can be used after recapture and download of the data in the following year, to approximate their migratory journeys. At the same time, we were in close contact with colleagues from Czechia also working on this species and equally thrilled to deploy these loggers on some of the individuals from their Bohemian Mountain populations.\nFieldwork went exceptionally and we had almost an entire year to make plans for the next field season in which we needed to especially look out for returning birds with geolocators, recapture them and retrieve the data containing so much information and the answer to our main questions of the birds’ whereabouts outside the breeding season. Both in northern Germany and in Czechia, we recaptured around 30% of the individuals (a reasonable return rate and the sample size we hoped for) just to learn that none of the devices recorded any data! Obviously, quite a downer that required some time to digest and to even think about rosefinch migration again. Yet, we decided to give it another go and repeat the study in 2013. This time we succeeded and collected useful data from several individuals.\n   Roland Neumann and Benjamin Metzger banding and measuring common rosefinches in the dunes of the Baltic Sea in Germany (left). Tomas Albrecht and Jaroslav Cepak preparing their mobile lab after a successful catch of rosefinches in the mountains of Bulgaria (right). (Photo credit: Simeon Lisovski, Pavel Munclinger)\nIn the meantime, we learned that other research groups from across Europe were also collecting migration data from rosefinches. Colleagues from Finland deployed geolocators on males breeding as far north as Oulu (65°N), a Swedish research team collected tracks from males in southern Sweden, and besides the German and Czech data, Bulgarian colleagues were also successful in tracking rosefinches from their southern European breeding site (41°N). Since all of us were dealing with rather small sample sizes (3-10 tracks), we were all easily convinced and excited to pool the data allowing us to not only investigate population specific migration pattern in isolation but extend our objectives towards a flyway wide approach. Now, we saw the opportunity to identify general migration routes, bottlenecks as well as barriers on the so far understudied Indo-European flyway.\nInspired, by previous large-scale research on the effects of wind on bird migration (Kranstauber et al. 2015 Ecology Letters) we constructed simple theoretical migration models that optimized the routes with respect to wind and resource availability during migration. These theoretical tracks revealed interesting patterns with seasonally specific bottlenecks such as the areas south of the Caspian Sea during spring migration. The comparison between the theoretical tracks and the collected empirical tracks also showed that rosefinches seem to make use of the straighter winds from India to Europe during spring, probably allowing for fast and direct migration to the breeding sites, while engaging in larger detours during autumn following the routes that provide highest security in terms of resources.\nTo me, this study shows how valuable even small and local studies can be, if seen as puzzle pieces helping to reveal the larger picture. Obviously, this needs an open and collaborative network of researchers which I am very glad to have encountered during this project. I would like to thank all of my co-authors for sharing not only their data but for providing their insights into the study systems, for fruitful discussion, for pushing me hard to explain the modeling approach and forcing me to meet empirical fieldwork and theory halfway!\n","date":1625184000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1625184000,"objectID":"77a3c8e93473ae1651bcd43aa82188a7","permalink":"https://slisovski.rbind.io/post/rosefinch/","publishdate":"2021-07-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/rosefinch/","section":"post","summary":"Editors’ Choice article: Lisovski, S., Neumann, R., Albrecht, T., Munclinger, P., Ahola, M.P., Bauer, S., Cepak, J., Fransson, T., Jakobsson, S., Jaakkonen, T., Klvana, P., Kullberg, C., Laaksonen, T., Metzger, B.","tags":["Flyway","Optimal migration","Rosefinch"],"title":"From Europe to India – A little investigated route of migratory birds","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"  You can downlaod wind (horizontal) u und (vertical) v vectors on a global scale for different pressure levels (altitudes) from the ERA-5 dataset.

However, processes underlying the introduction, evolution and maintenance of AIVs in Australia remain poorly understood. Waders (order _Charadriiformes_, family _Scolopacidae_) may play a unique role in the ecology and evolution of AIVs, particularly in Australia, where ducks, geese, and swans (order _Anseriformes_, family _Anatidae_) rarely undertake intercontinental migrations. Across a 5-year surveillance period (2011 to 2015), ruddy turnstones (_Arenaria interpres_) that 'overwinter' during the Austral summer in southeastern Australia showed generally low levels of AIV prevalence (0 to 2%). However, in March 2014, we detected AIVs in 32% (95% confidence interval [CI], 25 to 39%) of individuals in a small, low-density, island population 90 km from the Australian mainland. This epizootic comprised three distinct AIV genotypes, each of which represent a unique reassortment of Australian-, recently introduced Eurasian-, and recently introduced American-lineage gene segments. Strikingly, the Australian-lineage gene segments showed high similarity to those of H10N7 viruses isolated in 2010 and 2012 from poultry outbreaks 900 to 1,500 km to the north. Together with the diverse geographic origins of the American and Eurasian gene segments, these findings suggest extensive circulation and reassortment of AIVs within Australian wild birds over vast geographic distances. Our findings indicate that long-term surveillance in waders may yield unique insights into AIV gene flow, especially in geographic regions like Oceania, where Anatidae species do not display regular inter- or intracontinental migration.","tags":["Migration","Climate change","News and Views"],"title":"Reassortment and Persistence of Influenza A Viruses from Diverse Geographic Origins within Australian Wild Birds: Evidence from a Small, Isolated Population of Ruddy Turnstones","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"  Tutorial (all detailes will follow shortly) I recently submitted a simulation of migrating Bar-tailed godwits (Limosa lapponica) to a vizualisation competition initiated by the BES Movement Ecology SIG.

Here, we aim to identify potential migratory barriers and corridors, as well as general migration strategies within the understudied Indo-European flyway.\nLocation: Europe, Central Asia.\nMajor taxon studied: Common rosefinches.\nMethods: We used a combination of theoretical optimization modelling and empirical tracking of Common Rosefinches (Carpodacus erythrinus) breeding across a large latitudinal gradient in Europe. First, we identified optimal migration routes driven by wind and resource availability along the Indo-European flyway. Second, we tracked rosefinches from five breeding populations using light-level geolocators. Finally, we compared to what extent empirical tracks overlapped with the modelled optimal routes.\nResults: In autumn, theoretical wind driven migration routes formed a broad-front corridor connecting Europe and the Indian Subcontinent while the theoretical resource driven routes formed a distinct north-south divide. The latter pattern also reflected the rosefinch tracks with all but the most southerly breeding birds making a northern detour towards non-breeding sites in Pakistan and India. In spring, the resource availability model predicted a similar migratory divide, however, the southern route seemed relatively more favourable and closely matched with the optimal wind driven migration routes. Spring tracking data showed larger overlap with the modelled wind driven migration routes compared to the resource driven routes.\nMain conclusions: Optimal wind and resource driven migration routes along the Indo-European flyway are seasonally specific and to a large extend do not overlap with one another. Under these conditions, migratory birds adopt seasonally distinct migration strategies following energy minimization strategy in autumn, driven by resource availability, and time minimizing strategy in spring, driven by wind conditions. Our optimal migration models can be applied worldwide and used to validate against empirical data to explain large-scale biogeographic pattern of migratory animals.","tags":["Migration","Geolocation","Optimal migration"],"title":"The Indo-European flyway: Opportunities and constraints reflected by Common Rosefinches breeding across Europe","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David Li","Geoffrey Davison","Simeon Lisovski","Phil F.

Using geolocators and satellite tracking devices, we demonstrate for the first time that Common Redshanks (Tringa totanus) and Whimbrels (Numenius phaeopus) wintering in Singapore can directly fly over the Himalayas to reach breeding grounds in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and north-central Russia respectively. The results also show that migratory shorebirds wintering in Southeast Asia can use both the Central Asian Flyway and the East Asian-Australasian Flyway. For Redshanks, westerly-breeding birds crossed the Himalayas while more easterly breeders on the Plateau migrated east of the Himalayas. For Whimbrels, an individual that crossed the Himalayas was probably from a breeding population that was different from the others that migrated along the coast up the East Asian-Australasian Flyway. The minimum required altitude of routes of trans-Himalayan Redshanks were no higher on average than those of eastern migrants, but geolocator temperature data indicate that birds departing Singapore flew at high elevations even when not required to by topography, suggesting that the Himalayan mountain range may be less of a barrier than assumed.","tags":["Migration","Climate change","News and Views"],"title":"Shorebirds wintering in Southeast Asia demonstrate trans-Himalayan flights","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Simeon Lisovski","Ken Gosbell","Clive Minton","Marcel Klaassen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1605830400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1605830400,"objectID":"aba7b6dd6f6488b004ccbb766340e471","permalink":"https://slisovski.rbind.io/publication/journal-article/lisovski_et_al-2020-jae/","publishdate":"2020-11-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/journal-article/lisovski_et_al-2020-jae/","section":"publication","summary":"Many migratory birds are declining worldwide. In line with the general causes for the global biodiversity crisis, habitat loss, pollution, hunting, over-exploitation and climate change are thought to be at the basis of these population declines. Long-distance migrants seem especially vulnerable to rapid anthropogenic change, yet, the rate of decline across populations and species varies greatly within flyways. We hypothesize that differences in migration strategy, and notably stopover-site use, may be at the basis of these variations in resilience to global change. By identifying and comparing the migration strategies of two very closely related shorebird species, the Curlew sandpiper Calidris ferruginea and the Red-necked stint Calidris ruficollis, migrating from the same non-breeding site in Australia to similar breeding sites in the high Russian Arctic, we aimed to explain why these two species express differential resilience to rapid changes within their flyway resulting in different population trajectories in recent times. Based on 13 Curlew sandpiper and 16 Red-necked stint tracks from light-level geolocator tags, we found that individual Curlew sandpipers make use of fewer stopover areas along the flyway compared to Red-necked stints. Furthermore, and notably during northward migration, Curlew sandpipers have a higher dependency on fewer sites, both in terms of the percentage of individuals visiting key stopover sites and the relative time spent at those sites. While Curlew sandpipers rely mainly on the Yellow Sea region, which has recently experienced a sharp decline in suitable habitat, Red-necked stints make use of additional sites and spread their relative time en-route across sites more evenly. Our results indicate that differential migration strategies may explain why Curlew sandpipers within the East Asian-Australasian Flyway are declining rapidly (9.5%–5.5% per year) while Red-necked stints remain relatively stable (−3.1%–0%). We consider that more generally, the number of sites per individual and among a population, the spatial distribution across the flyway, as well as the relationship between the time spent over sites may prove to be key variables explaining populations and species' differential resilience to environmental change.","tags":["Migration","Macroecology"],"title":"Migration strategy as an indicator of resilience to change in two shorebird species with contrasting population trajectories","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Martins Briedis","Silke Bauer","Peter Adamík","José A Alves","Joana S Costa","Tamara Emmenegger","Lars Gustafsson","Jaroslav Koleček","Miloš Krist","Felix Liechti","Simeon Lisovski","Christoph M Meier","Petr Procházka","Steffen Hahn"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1585699200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1585699200,"objectID":"1d8b489e369802c4fe4dffd35cb0da16","permalink":"https://slisovski.rbind.io/publication/journal-article/briedis_et_al-2020-globalecolbiog/","publishdate":"2020-04-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/journal-article/briedis_et_al-2020-globalecolbiog/","section":"publication","summary":"Aim: Knowledge of broad-scale biogeographical patterns of animal migration is important for understanding ecological drivers of migratory behaviours. Here, we present a flyway-scale assessment of the spatial structure and seasonal dynamics of the Afro-Palaearctic bird migration system and explore how phenology of the environment guides long-distance migration.\nLocation: Europe and Africa.\nTime period: 2009–2017.\nMajor taxa studied: Birds.\nMethods: We compiled an individual-based dataset comprising 23 passerine and near-passerine species of 55 European breeding populations, in which a total of 564 individuals were tracked during migration between Europe and sub-Saharan Africa. In addition, we used remotely sensed primary productivity data (the normalized difference vegetation index) to estimate the timing of vegetation green-up in spring and senescence in autumn across Europe. First, we described how individual breeding and non-breeding sites and the migratory flyways link geographically. Second, we examined how the timing of migration along the two major Afro-Palaearctic flyways is tuned with vegetation phenology at the breeding sites.\nResults: We found the longitudes of individual breeding and non-breeding sites to be related in a strongly positive manner, whereas the latitudes of breeding and non-breeding sites were related negatively. In autumn, migration commenced ahead of vegetation senescence, and the timing of migration was 5–7 days earlier along the Western flyway compared with the Eastern flyway. In spring, the time of arrival at breeding sites was c. 1.5 days later for each degree northwards and 6–7 days later along the Eastern compared with the Western flyway, reflecting the later spring green-up at higher latitudes and more eastern longitudes.\nMain conclusions: Migration of the Afro-Palaearctic landbirds follows a longitudinally parallel leapfrog migration pattern, whereby migrants track vegetation green-up in spring but depart before vegetation senescence in autumn. The degree of continentality along migration routes and at the breeding sites of the birds influences the timing of migration on a broad scale.","tags":["Migration","Macroecology"],"title":"Broad‐scale patterns of the Afro‐Palaearctic landbird migration","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Meijuan Zhao","Chris A.

As a potential rapid alternative, we can measure variables correlated to age, allowing the compilation of population age distributions, from which mortality rates can be derived. However, most studies employing such techniques have ignored their inherent inaccuracy and have thereby failed to provide reliable mortality estimates. In this study, we present a general statistical model linking birth rate, mortality rate, and population age distributions. We next assessed the reliability and data needs (i.e., sample size) for estimating mortality rate of eight different aging techniques. The results revealed that for half of the aging techniques, correlations with age varied considerably, translating into highly variable accuracies when used to estimate mortality rate from age distributions. Telomere length is generally not sufficiently correlated to age to provide reliable mortality rate estimates. DNA methylation, signal-joint T-cell recombination excision circle (sjTREC), and racemization are generally more promising techniques to ultimately estimate mortality rate, if a sufficiently high sample size is available. Otolith ring counts, otolithometry, and age-length keys in fish, and skeletochronology in reptiles, mammals, and amphibians, outperformed all other aging techniques and generated relatively accurate mortality rate estimation with a sample size that can be feasibly obtained. Provided the method chosen is minimizing and estimating the error in age estimation, it is possible to accurately estimate mortality rates from age distributions. The method therewith has the potential to estimate a critical, population dynamic parameter to inform conservation efforts within a limited time frame as opposed to mark–recapture analyses.","tags":null,"title":"The adequacy of aging techniques in vertebrates for rapid estimation of population mortality rates from age distributions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Simeon Lisovski"],"categories":[],"content":"Established in 1987, the ARGOS system allowed the world-wide tracking of animals equipped with satellite transmitters. This new technology provided unprecedented insights into the movements of animals. But the devices were bulky as well as heavy and not yet ready to track the majority of smaller species like birds. In search for alternatives, the biologist Rory Wilson recalled that early voyagers did not have on-board GPS, nor satellite transmitters to ascertain their position (1). Instead, they observed the sun`s trajectory to estimate their whereabouts, using the day length to derive latitude and the exact time of noon to estimate longitude. He concluded that a simple light sensor, which requires far less power than a satellite transmitter, may provide reliable information about seabird movements across the annual cycle. After designing tags that consisted of a light sensor, a clock, a memory chip, and a lithium battery, he first deployed these tags on wandering albatrosses and Magellanic penguins.\nSince then, geolocation by light has come a long way and is currently one of the most frequently used tracking technologies in bird migration research. A real boost in the number of applications happened after Bridget Stutchbury and her team deployed 1.5g geolocators developed by the British Antarctic Survey on different songbird species in 2008 (2). Recently, Migrate Technology Ltd. developed a 0.32g logger that successfully recorded a 13.000km migration route of 10g Willow warblers from Far East Russia to East Africa (3).\n   Figure 1: One of the first light-level geolocators deployed on an animal, a Magellanic penguin, to track its movement. The tag was developed, built and deployed by Rory Wilson, despite huge amount of flack for this approach criticising that this method was only good for revealing movement on an ocean basin scale. One of the most recent developed tag weights only 0.35 g (from Migrate Technology Ltd.) and was used to track a 10 g Willow warbler (right). Image credits: Rory Wilson (left, centre), Harald Ris (right).\nHowever, there was not only the need to build smaller and smaller tags, but to develop tools and methods that produce scientifically sound and reproducible tracks from light intensity recordings. The major downside of this technology is arguable the low accuracy compared to satellite mediated locations that results from the fact that light almost never hits the sensor of the logger without some level of shading. And even worse, the very same amount of shading has a very different effect on the accuracy depending on the time of the year and the actual location of the logger on the globe. Thus, researcher regularly struggled in the analysis and interpretation of the results.\nIn 2011 the Swiss Ornithological Institute organised a first international workshop, at a beautiful site in the Alps, to discuss methods and potential developments of open source tools for the analysis of geolocator data. The National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis funded another meeting in 2013 taking place in Santa Barbara, California. Stimulated or improved by these meetings, various R packages and other open source tools emerged that allow users to apply different theories and use additional information to improve the accuracy and precision of location estimates based on light recordings. In our \u0026lsquo;HOW TO\u0026hellip;\u0026rsquo; paper that is part of the special issue on biologging in Journal of Animal Ecology (Lisovski et al. 2020) we now provide an overview of the different tools that may help in choosing an appropriate analysis method. Furthermore, we give advice on how to interpret and report results and introduce a comprehensive online manual that applies the concepts to several datasets, demonstrates the use of open‐source analysis tools with step‐by‐step instructions and code and details our recommendations for interpreting, reporting and archiving link.\n   Figure 2: Coding jam at the 1st international workshop on how to best analyse light level geolocator data to ensure sound and reproducible results (left). Michael Sumner guide to geolocation by light (right): Photo credit: Felix Liechti.\nAnd even though satellite tags are becoming smaller and smaller too, allowing to track small birds with high accuracy, we consider our efforts to be of value to the research community for the years to come. In addition to the relatively low costs, several recent technological advancements will perhaps even increase the appeal of light level geolocators. The most important among them is probably the combination of light recording with other en-route data, such as air pressure, acceleration, magnetism and temperature. These additional data can facilitate the refinement of location estimates. For instance, acceleration data or changes in air pressure can distinguish movement and residency periods relatively easily, and such prior knowledge can then be fed into the stationary location estimation. These additional sensor data also provide a wealth of complementary information on fine‐scale behaviour: air pressure and temperature can be used to infer flight altitude and initiation and termination of migratory or foraging flights; acceleration data can be used to determine daily activity budgets and, given supplementary measurements, be related to energy expenditure and energy budgets; magnetic field data can be used to infer strategies in orientation and navigation during migration. Combining such behavioural information with refined, reliable and accurate location estimates can assist in identifying habitat associations of migrants or their responses to evolutionarily novel factors such as artificial light at night, sensory pollution or wind farms. This knowledge will improve our understanding of the fates of migrants and the bottlenecks they might experience at sensitive times and places, which will allow us to improve our conservation and management strategies for migratory populations.\n link to the online user guide: https://geolocationmanual.vogelwarte.ch/\n Original publication: Lisovski, S., Bauer, S., Briedis, M., Davidson, S.C., Dhanjal-Adams, K.L., Hallworth, M.T., Karagicheva, J., Meier, C.M., Merkel, B., Ouwehand, J., Pedersen, L., Rakhimberdiev, E., Roberto-Charron, A., Seavy, N.E., Sumner, M.D., Taylor, C.M., Wotherspoon, S.J. \u0026amp; E.S.

Why?\nThere are a few ideas. The main one is that Australian ducks tend not to migrate beyond the Australian-Papuan area; it’s ducks that have been implicated in the spread of H5N8 and H5N6 to Europe and North America.\nBut ducks aren’t the only birds who act as hosts for avian influenza – shorebirds can too.\nIn our study, published in the journal Emerging Infectious Disease, we wanted to understand whether shorebirds that spend the summer months in Australia are being infected with HPAIV when they weren’t in Australia.\nTo understand this, at the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, we tested two species – the incredible Tim Tam biscuit sized migratory shorebird called the Red-necked Stint, and a common Australian duck species called the Pacific Black Duck.\nAs part of a long term collaboration with the Victorian Wader Study Group, Field and Game Australia with students from Deakin University, between 2011 and 2018, we collected over 1,500 blood samples from Red-necked Stint and 400 blood samples from Pacific Black Ducks.\nWe tested these samples for general influenza antibodies, as well as antibodies against specific strains of influenza.\nWe found that our long-distance migrator, the Red-necked Stint, did have antibodies against HPAIV. These were particularly found in blood samples collected since 2014 and the emergence of H5N8 and H5N6.\n   Figure 1: The migration routes of Red-necked Stints have substantial overlap with areas where HPAIV is endemic. Credit Simeon Lisovski as part of ongoing projects with the Victorian Wader Study Group.\nThese antibodies tell us that the birds were infected with highly pathogenic influenza and that their immune system generated a response.\nBut, there is no evidence that they still carry the virus when they arrive in Australia\nThe problem with analysing antibodies is that we don’t know when or where these birds were infected. To make sure they weren’t infected in Australia, we tested local ducks.\nIf these viruses were in Australia, local ducks would definitely have antibodies against them.\nOur study found no evidence of these antibodies in the ducks and so we believe that Red-necked Stints are being infected somewhere in their migration outside Australia.\nThis finding is important for two reasons.\nFirst, if these highly pathogenic viruses were to make it to Australia, we now know it could be on the wings of shorebirds.\nThe introduction of HPAIV would have huge ramifications for the local poultry industry; there is currently a nationwide wild bird surveillance program in place for detection .\nSecond, most shorebird species are in a dramatic decline, and recovery plans are in place for many species.\nDisease is often not included in these plans, but the results of our study strongly indicate that these birds are exposed to HPAIV, potentially adding to the decline of these amazing avian athletes.\nThis study was completed in collaboration with Deakin University, the CSIRO Australian Animal Health Laboratory, and the Australian Commonwealth Government Department of Agriculture.\nLink to original blogpost.\n","date":1567036800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1567036800,"objectID":"25b8d7b665edefee902b2cb8e7d002e2","permalink":"https://slisovski.rbind.io/post/virusstints/","publishdate":"2019-08-29T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/virusstints/","section":"post","summary":"The migration of these small birds is fraught with difficulties, and most species will stop along the way to refuel.\nSome of the most common stop-over sites are in South-east Asia and along the Yellow Sea, areas where highly pathogenic avian influenza is now endemic.","tags":["Disease dynamics","Shorebirds"],"title":"How our ‘Avian Athlets’ could spread influenza","type":"post"},{"authors":["Simeon Lisovski","Silke Bauer","Martins Briedis","Sarah C.

We used ringing, tracking and stable hydrogen isotope (δ2 H) analysis of individuals migrating along the Pacifc Flyway to assess individual phenology and routes as well as the pattern of connectivity between breeding and non-breeding sites. Results from all three methods, consisting of 79 ring recoveries, four light level geolocator tracks and 388 feather δ2 H values, indicate low degrees of migratory connectivity. The isotope data provide evidence for leapfrog migration with the more southerly populations traveling greater distances to the breeding grounds than more centrally wintering individuals. Location estimates of four annual journeys revealed individually consistent migration strategies with relatively short fight bouts separated by two to three and two to six stopover sites during spring and autumn migration, respectively. However, combined results from all methods indicate high variability in migration distance among individuals. These fndings confrm the phenotypic fexibility observed within this species and highlight the potential of White-crowned Sparrows for further investigations of evolutionary adaptations to ongoing changes in the environment.","tags":null,"title":"Migration pattern of Gambel’s White‑crowned Sparrow along the Pacifc Flyway","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Vojtěch Brlík","Jaroslav Koleček","Malcolm Burgess","Steffen Hahn","Diana Humple","Miloš Krist","Janne Ouwehand","Emily L.

During the austral winter, shearwaters migrated across the central Indian Ocean to their non-breeding grounds off western Sri Lanka.

As a potential rapid alternative, we can measure variables correlated to age, allowing the compilation of population age distributions, from which mortality rates can be derived. However, most studies employing such techniques have ignored their inherent inaccuracy and have thereby failed to provide reliable mortality estimates. In this study, we present a general statistical model linking birth rate, mortality rate, and population age distributions. We next assessed the reliability and data needs (i.e., sample size) for estimating mortality rate of eight different aging techniques. The results revealed that for half of the aging techniques, correlations with age varied considerably, translating into highly variable accuracies when used to estimate mortality rate from age distributions. Telomere length is generally not sufficiently correlated to age to provide reliable mortality rate estimates. DNA methylation, signal‐joint T‐cell recombination excision circle (sjTREC), and racemization are generally more promising techniques to ultimately estimate mortality rate, if a sufficiently high sample size is available. Otolith ring counts, otolithometry, and age‐length keys in fish, and skeletochronology in reptiles, mammals, and amphibians, outperformed all other aging techniques and generated relatively accurate mortality rate estimation with a sample size that can be feasibly obtained. Provided the method chosen is minimizing and estimating the error in age estimation, it is possible to accurately estimate mortality rates from age distributions. The method therewith has the potential to estimate a critical, population dynamic parameter to inform conservation efforts within a limited time frame as opposed to mark–recapture analyses.","tags":null,"title":"The adequacy of aging techniques in vertebrates for rapid estimation of population mortality rates from age distributions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Volker Salewski","Martin Flade","[Simeon Lisovski](hhttps://slisovski.netlify.com/)","Anatolii Poluda","Oleksander Iliukha","Grzegorz Kiljan","UladzimirR Malasgevich","Steffen Hahn"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1544054400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1544054400,"objectID":"407a321a5ba02b7656f9b060858ad31f","permalink":"https://slisovski.rbind.io/publication/journal-article/salewski_et_al-2018-birdconsint/","publishdate":"2018-12-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/journal-article/salewski_et_al-2018-birdconsint/","section":"publication","summary":"Birds that are long-distance migrants partition their annual cycle among a number of locations over a large spatial range. The conservation of these species is particularly complex because it requires attention to a number of different and distant habitats based on knowledge of migratory phenology, routes and staging areas. In the case of the globally threatened Aquatic Warbler Acrocephalus paludicola, a habitat specialist that breeds in Europe and spends the boreal winter in sub-Saharan Africa, non-breeding staging areas were widely unknown until recently. We applied light-level geolocators to adult male Aquatic Warblers at breeding sites in Belarus and Ukraine. Data from eight retrieved geolocators confirmed a south-west and then westward migration route through Europe via the northern Mediterranean with staging sites on the Iberian Peninsula and occasionally France and north-west Africa. In sub-Saharan Africa, final staging areas were in Mali, either in the Inner Niger Delta or at (presumably) small water bodies in the desert, with one bird most likely staying in the north of Ivory Coast south of the previously assumed range. The birds probably stayed in the final staging areas for most of the non-breeding season, but the logger on only one bird provided data throughout the entire migration cycle. Pre-nuptial migration of the latter was by a more easterly route than the southward migration. Our study suggests that conservation strategies for Aquatic Warbler north of the Sahara should include consideration of unknown staging sites in the northern Mediterranean as well as on the Iberian Peninsula and in north-west Africa. South of the Sahara, our study demonstrates the importance of the Sahel for the conservation of the Aquatic Warbler, including both the major floodplains of the Niger River and small Sahelian wetlands that are under pressure from human development.","tags":null,"title":"Identifying migration routes and non-breeding staging sites of adult males of the globally threatened Aquatic Warbler _Acrocephalus paludicola_","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Silke Bauer","Simeon Lisovski","Ramona J.

Control and management measures are sought after but since migratory geese use several sites in their annual cycle, local management actions should consider their potential effects further down the flyway. 2) We used a behaviour‐based migration model to illustrate the consequences of management actions involving hunting, derogation shooting and scaring at single or multiple locations along the flyway, considering various mechanisms of how geese might perceive shooting/hunting. Furthermore, as a proxy for the agricultural damage caused, we calculated the per capita biomass consumption between scenarios—both over time and cumulatively.\n3) We found that hunting, shooting and scaring can result in a suite of direct and indirect consequences on migration and foraging behaviour. Most importantly, hunting/shooting on a particular site had implications not only for the behaviour at the actual site but also for behaviour at, and use of, other sites. Furthermore, the specific consequences of shooting/hunting could be counter‐intuitive, that is, aggravate rather than alleviate agricultural damage, depending on where along the migration route changes had taken place and the mechanisms through which hunting/shooting was assumed to affect geese.\n4) Synthesis and applications. Management plans are being discussed or implemented for several migratory goose populations and often include shooting, hunting or scaring at one or multiple locations. Using a behaviour‐based model, we assessed the consequences of such local management measures and found that they can indeed lead to a reduction of agricultural conflicts locally but may also aggravate the conflict or shift it to other sites along the flyway. Thus, we recommend the use of these models to scrutinize the efficiency of specific management measures and to assist in identifying an international management regime that minimizes conflicts on a flyway level while still maintaining migratory populations.","tags":null,"title":"Shooting may aggravate rather than alleviate conflicts between migratory geese and agriculture","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Simeon Lisovski"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1539561600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1539561600,"objectID":"51a70859e9ee891b2cc70b89337dd456","permalink":"https://slisovski.rbind.io/publication/journal-article/lisovski-2018_waderstudy/","publishdate":"2018-10-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/journal-article/lisovski-2018_waderstudy/","section":"publication","summary":"Solar geolocation has become one of the most frequently used tools in wader migration research. Geolocators provide location estimates based on recorded light intensities, and more specifically, on the changes in light during the twilight periods, allowing an increase in knowledge on how waders migrate across the globe. Yet, quite a number of species breed in polar regions where they experience 24-hour daylight. Given the lack of recorded twilight times on the geolocators during this period, analysis methods have been unable to resolve birds’ positions when they are in constant daylight. This is especially problematic in the older geolocator generations that could record light only over a narrow range of light intensities. Some newer geolocators record the full light range, allowing even small changes in light intensity during the day (under bright light conditions) to be detected. However, the common methods for estimating locations are not designed for changes in high light regimes that lack dark periods during the night. Previously, I developed and implemented a method for analysing continuous light records, which evaluates the likelihood of a measured light cycle being from a given location, leading to first estimates of breeding sites in Sanderlings Calidris alba and Great Knots C. tenuirostris. However, the final decision on the breeding site was somewhat subjective and a formal description of the method was still lacking.

Though we have some understanding of where and when they travel, we still have very little insight into who migrates with whom and for how long. Group formation is pivotal in allowing individuals to interact, transfer information, and adapt to changing conditions. Yet it is remarkably difficult to infer group membership in migrating animals without being able to directly observe them. Here, we use novel lightweight atmospheric pressure loggers to monitor group dynamics in a small migratory bird, the European bee-eater ( Merops apiaster). We present the first evidence of a migratory bird flying together with non-kin of different ages and sexes at all stages of the life cycle. In fact, 49% stay together throughout the annual cycle, never separating longer than 5 days at a time despite the ∼14,000-km journey. Of those that separated for longer, 89% reunited within less than a month with individuals they had previously spent time with, having flown up to 5,000 km apart. These birds were not only using the same non-breeding sites, but also displayed coordinated foraging behaviors—these are unlikely to result from chance encounters in response to the same environmental conditions alone.

Therefore, local actions may not only affect how migratory animals behave and forage locally, but also when they move to another site, and how they behave and forage when there.\nUnlike many other migratory species, most migratory goose populations have thrived in recent decades and massively increased their abundances. One reason behind these increases is probably their switch to agricultural food, which is abundantly available over long periods in the year. However, this use of agricultural resources frequently leads to conflicts with farmers. Control and management measures are therefore called for that have the shared objective of reducing these conflicts but still maintaining migratory populations.\n   Figure 1: Model predictions for the migration of White-fronted geese in the default case (left panel), with predation risk increased by a factor of 10 (middle panel) or 100 (right panel).\nGeese are interacting with humans on various sites along the flyway. In the wintering area, they are left undisturbed or are increasingly shot for management purposes, while on most migratory sites geese are a quarry species. For example, in Russia geese are hunted mainly during spring migration.\nWe used a theoretical approach – a behaviour-based migration model – to assess the consequences of derogation shooting, hunting and scaring on the migration behaviour and demographic rates of geese, and how these accumulate in agricultural damage. We applied this model to the Baltic-North Sea population of white-fronted geese (Anser albifrons), which has increased from 10,000-50,000 in the 1950s to 1,200,000 around 2010, raising serious conflicts with agriculture, particularly in the Netherlands where the majority of these geese overwinter. We were particularly interested in whether such actions would alleviate conflicts with agriculture or pass on the problem to other sites. We ran scenarios with shooting/hunting being installed at single or multiple locations.\n   Figure 2: White-fronted geese. © Helmut Kruckenberg\nWe found that hunting, shooting and scaring can result in a suite of direct and indirect consequences on migration and foraging behaviour – from less intense foraging and later migratory departure, to avoiding sites. Most importantly, changing conditions on a particular site, be it through management or natural processes, not only alters the behaviour of migrants immediately and locally, but could also do so at a later time and at a distance. Furthermore, the specific consequences of shooting/hunting could be counter-intuitive, i.e. aggravate rather than alleviate agricultural damage, depending on where along the migration route changes had taken place and the mechanisms through which hunting/shooting was assumed to affect geese. This means that although local management actions can be effective locally, i.e. chase geese away or force them to migrate earlier, these might pass on the problem to sites further down the flyway.\nWhile our modelling approach made several simplifying assumptions and can only be a first step in developing an adaptive management plan, our results do underline that management plans for migratory geese should be formulated and evaluated on a flyway level.\nRead the full article, Shooting may aggravate rather than alleviate conflicts between migratory geese and agriculture in Journal of Applied Ecology.\nLink to original blogpost.\nLink to article download.\n","date":1527724800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1527724800,"objectID":"f927abe3a39a9ddb32425fd0624a37ee","permalink":"https://slisovski.rbind.io/post/huntingmodel/","publishdate":"2018-05-31T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/huntingmodel/","section":"post","summary":"Following the recent article, Shooting may aggravate rather than alleviate conflicts between migratory geese and agriculture, Silke Bauer explains why management plans for migratory goose populations need to be considered across a broader scale.","tags":["Optimal migration","Stochastic dynamic programing","R"],"title":"Mitigating conflicts between agriculture and migratory geese: is shooting a viable option or just passing on the problem?","type":"post"},{"authors":["Vojtěch Brlík","Mihaela Ilieva","Simeon Lisovski","Christian C.

Data from one geolocator deployed on a Paddyfield Warbler at a recently established breeding site in Bulgaria show that this individual retraced the recent range expansion and followed a rather conservative route instead of migrating directly to India. An additional stable hydrogen (δ2H) analysis of feathers from 25 individual breeding birds in Bulgaria that had been grown during their stay in the non-breeding grounds indicated a low degree of migratory connectivity at the non-breeding grounds.

Although management actions aimed at mitigating effects of habitat loss and predation have been largely effective, numbers continue to decline, which suggests that the population may be limited during the nonbreeding season. Between 2013 and 2015, we used light-level geolocators to track Common Terns nesting at 5 inland colonies—from Lake Winnipeg in Manitoba, Canada, to the eastern Great Lakes region of the United States and Canada—to identify migratory routes and stopover and wintering sites and to determine the strength of migratory connectivity among colonies. Within 46 recovered tracks, we found evidence of a longitudinal gradient in use of migration routes and stopover sites among colonies and identified major staging areas in the lower Great Lakes and at inland and coastal locations along the Atlantic coast, Florida, and the Gulf of Mexico. Low migratory connectivity across inland colonies illustrates high intermixing within wintering sites, with many birds spending the nonbreeding season in Peru (70%) and the remainder spread throughout the Gulf of Mexico, Central America, and northwestern South America. While the large spatial spread and intermixing of individuals during the nonbreeding season may buffer local effects of climate change and human disturbance, the aggregation of individuals along the coast of Peru could make them vulnerable to events or changes within this region, such as increased frequency and intensity of storms in the Pacific, that are predicted to negatively influence breeding productivity and survival of Common Terns. Identifying sources of mortality during the nonbreeding season, quantifying winter site fidelity, and reinforcing the importance of continued management of inland breeding colonies are vital priorities for effective conservation and management of this vulnerable population.","tags":null,"title":"Migratory routes and wintering locations of declining inland North American Common Terns","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Simeon Lisovski","Jacintha G.

We investigated five (mutually non‐ exclusive) mechanisms potentially driving observed prevalence patterns: (1) a pronounced birth pulse (e.g. the synchronised annual influx of immunologically naïve individuals), (2) short‐term immunity, (3) increase in susceptible migrants, (4) differential susceptibility to infection (i.e. transmission rate) for migrants and residents, and (5) replacement of migrants during peak migration.\n3. SIR models describing all possible combinations of the five mechanisms were fitted to individual AIV infection data from a detailed longitudinal surveillance study in the partially migratory mallard duck (Anas platyrhynchos). During autumn and winter, the local resident mallard community also held migratory mallards that exhibited distinct AIV infection dynamics.\n4. Replacement of migratory birds during peak migration in autumn was found to be the most important mechanism driving the variation in local AIV infection patterns. This suggests that a constant influx of migratory birds, likely immunological naïve to locally circulating AIV strains, is required to predict the observed temporal prevalence patterns and the distinct differences in prevalence between residents and migrants.\n5. Synthesis and applications. Our analysis reveals a key mechanism that could explain the amplifying role of migratory birds in local avian influenza virus infection dynamics; the constant flow and replacement of migratory birds during peak migration. Apart from monitoring efforts, in order to achieve adequate disease management and control in wildlife—with knock‐on effects for livestock and humans,—we conclude that it is crucial, in future surveillance studies, to record host demographical parameters such as population density, timing of birth and turnover of migrants.","tags":null,"title":"The roles of migratory and resident birds in local avian influenza infection dynamics","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tracey Russell","Simeon Lisovski","Mats Olsson","Gregory Brown","Rebecca Spindler","Amanda Lane","Tamara Keeley","Chris Hibbard","Carolyn J.

Our results therefore suggest that devil reproductive success is subject to disruptive MHC selection, which to our knowledge has never been recorded in any vertebrate.

From light-level geolocator data, wherein geographical locations are estimated via the timing of sunrise and sunset, Streby et al.

The authors presented this finding as evidence that migratory birds avoid severe storms by temporarily moving long-distances. However, the tracking method employed by Streby et al.

Understanding how migration scales with body size across species is fundamental in the development of migration theory and in making size‐related predictions. Although aerodynamic theory and ecophysiological scaling laws have assisted greatly in generating such predictions, their verifications have been limited by a lack of empirical data across a range of body sizes. The recent development of ultra‐light tracking devices and its rapid application to migration now allows us to put theory to the test. We used tracking data of seven closely related migratory sandpiper species (family Scolopacidae) along the East Asian‐Australasian Flyway to compare their migratory behaviour when migrating towards the breeding grounds as a function of size (50–750 g). We found a marked decline in migration speed (migration distance divided by total migration duration, including time at stopover sites and in flight) with size. Departure date from the non‐breeding (i.e. wintering) ground and arrival date at the breeding ground also scaled negatively with size. Total migration duration, migration distance, total staging duration (the number of days staying at stopover sites plus days preparing, i.e. fuelling, prior to initial migration) and step length (distance covered within one migratory leg) were not significantly related with size. Correction for phylogeny showed consistent results for all variables. Besides improving our fundamental understanding of inter‐specific variation in migration behaviours, the finding of a clear scaling with size in migration speed and migration timing highlight differential size related capabilities and constraints of migrants. Migratory birds, including sandpipers, are declining on a global scale and particularly along the East Asian‐Australasian Flyway. This notion of size‐dependency in migratory traits may have a bearing on their vulnerability to specific environmental disturbances along their flyways.","tags":null,"title":"Body size shapes inter‐specific migratory behaviour: evidence from individual tracks of long‐distance migratory shorebirds","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Meijuan Zhao","Maureen Christie","Jonathan Coleman","Chris Hassell","Ken Gosbell","Simeon Lisovski","Clive Minton","Marcel Klaassen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1510012800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1510012800,"objectID":"baff1d8f7289e23ce2ac622936a5da8e","permalink":"https://slisovski.rbind.io/publication/journal-article/zhao_et_al-2017-movecol/","publishdate":"2017-11-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/journal-article/zhao_et_al-2017-movecol/","section":"publication","summary":"Background: Migrants have been hypothesised to use different migration strategies between seasons: a time-minimization strategy during their pre-breeding migration towards the breeding grounds and an energy-minimization strategy during their post-breeding migration towards the wintering grounds. Besides season, we propose body size as a key factor in shaping migratory behaviour. Specifically, given that body size is expected to correlate negatively with maximum migration speed and that large birds tend to use more time to complete their annual life-history events (such as moult, breeding and migration), we hypothesise that large-sized species are time stressed all year round. Consequently, large birds are not only likely to adopt a time-minimization strategy during pre-breeding migration, but also during post-breeding migration, to guarantee a timely arrival at both the non-breeding (i.e. wintering) and breeding grounds.\nMethods: We tested this idea using individual tracks across six long-distance migratory shorebird species (family Scolopacidae) along the East Asian-Australasian Flyway varying in size from 50 g to 750 g lean body mass. Migration performance was compared between pre- and post-breeding migration using four quantifiable migratory behaviours that serve to distinguish between a time- and energy-minimization strategy, including migration speed, number of staging sites, total migration distance and step length from one site to the next.\nResults: During pre- and post-breeding migration, the shorebirds generally covered similar distances, but they tended to migrate faster, used fewer staging sites, and tended to use longer step lengths during pre-breeding migration. These seasonal differences are consistent with the prediction that a time-minimization strategy is used during pre-breeding migration, whereas an energy-minimization strategy is used during post-breeding migration. However, there was also a tendency for the seasonal difference in migration speed to progressively disappear with an increase in body size, supporting our hypothesis that larger species tend to use time-minimization strategies during both pre- and post-breeding migration.\nConclusions: Our study highlights that body size plays an important role in shaping migratory behaviour. Larger migratory bird species are potentially time constrained during not only the pre- but also the post-breeding migration. Conservation of their habitats during both seasons may thus be crucial for averting further population declines.","tags":null,"title":"Time versus energy minimization migration strategy varies with body size and season in long-distance migratory shorebirds","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Simeon Lisovski","Marilyn Ramenofsky","John C Wingfield"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1509494400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1509494400,"objectID":"a421055643be0962803fd7aef3550103","permalink":"https://slisovski.rbind.io/publication/journal-article/lisovski_et_al-2017-icb/","publishdate":"2017-11-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/journal-article/lisovski_et_al-2017-icb/","section":"publication","summary":"Seasonality describes cyclic and largely predictable fluctuations in the environment. Such variations in day length, temperature, rainfall, and resource availability are ubiquitous and can exert strong selection pressure on organisms to adapt to seasonal environments. However, seasonal variations exhibit large scale geographical divergences caused by a whole suite of factors such as solar radiation, ocean currents, extent of continents, and topography. Realizing these contributions in driving patterns of overall seasonality may help advance our understanding of the kinds of evolutionary adaptations we should expect at a global scale. Here, we introduce a new concept and provide the data describing the overall degree of seasonality, based on its two major components—amplitude and predictability. Using global terrestrial datasets on temperature, precipitation and primary productivity, we show that these important seasonal factors exhibit strong differences in their spatial patterns with notable asymmetries between the southern and the northern hemisphere. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that seasonality is highly diverse across latitudes as well as longitudinal gradients. This indicates that using a direct measure of seasonality and its components, amplitude and predictability, may yield a better understanding of how organisms are adapted to seasonal environments and provide support for predictions on the consequences of rapid environmental change.","tags":null,"title":"Defining the Degree of Seasonality and its Significance for Future Research","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nynke Raven","Simeon Lisovski","Marcel Klaassen","Nathan Lob","Thomas Madsen","Simon Y.W.

Despite the potential value of these species to immunoecology and disease epidemiology, previous studies have typically focused on their adaptive immune gene repertoires. In this study, we examined the evolution of innate immune genes in three long-distance migratory waders (order Charadriiformes). We analysed two parts of the extracellular domains of two Toll-like receptors (TLR3 and TLR7) involved in virus recognition in the Sanderling (Calidris alba), Red-necked Stint (Calidris ruficollis), and Ruddy Turnstone (Arenaria interpres). Our analysis was extended to 50 avian species for which whole-genome sequences were available, including two additional waders. We found that the inferred relationships among avian TLR3 and TLR7 do not match the whole-genome phylogeny of birds. Further analyses showed that although both loci are predominantly under purifying selection, the evolution of the extracellular domain of avian TLR3 has also been driven by episodic diversifying selection. TLR7 was found to be duplicated in all five wader species and in two other orders of birds, Cuculiformes and Passeriformes. The duplication is likely to have occurred in the ancestor of each order, and the duplicated copies appear to be undergoing concerted evolution. The phylogenetic relationships of wader TLR7 matched those of the five wader species, but that of TLR3 did not. Instead, the tree inferred from TLR3 showed potential associations with the species' ecology, including migratory behaviour and exposure to pathogens. Our study demonstrates the importance of combining immunological and ecological knowledge to understand the impact of immune gene polymorphism on the evolutionary ecology of infectious diseases.","tags":null,"title":"Purifying selection and concerted evolution of RNA-sensing toll-like receptors in migratory waders","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Caroline M Williams","Gregory J Ragland","Gustavo Betini","Lauren B Buckley","Zachary A Cheviron","Kathleen Donohue","Joe Hereford","Murray M Humphries","Simeon Lisovski"," Katie E Marshall","Paul S Schmidt","Kimberly S Sheldon","Øystein Varpe","Marcel E Visser"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1509494400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1509494400,"objectID":"40f3464fdb807b93c142e628ccd74f75","permalink":"https://slisovski.rbind.io/publication/journal-article/williams_et_al_2017-icb/","publishdate":"2017-11-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/journal-article/williams_et_al_2017-icb/","section":"publication","summary":"Seasonality is a critically important aspect of environmental variability, and strongly shapes all aspects of life for organisms living in highly seasonal environments. Seasonality has played a key role in generating biodiversity, and has driven the evolution of extreme physiological adaptations and behaviors such as migration and hibernation. Fluctuating selection pressures on survival and fecundity between summer and winter provide a complex selective landscape, which can be met by a combination of three outcomes of adaptive evolution: genetic polymorphism, phenotypic plasticity, and bet-hedging. Here, we have identified four important research questions with the goal of advancing our understanding of evolutionary impacts of seasonality. First, we ask how characteristics of environments and species will determine which adaptive response occurs. Relevant characteristics include costs and limits of plasticity, predictability, and reliability of cues, and grain of environmental variation relative to generation time. A second important question is how phenological shifts will amplify or ameliorate selection on physiological hardiness. Shifts in phenology can preserve the thermal niche despite shifts in climate, but may fail to completely conserve the niche or may even expose life stages to conditions that cause mortality. Considering distinct environmental sensitivities of life history stages will be key to refining models that forecast susceptibility to climate change. Third, we must identify critical physiological phenotypes that underlie seasonal adaptation and work toward understanding the genetic architectures of these responses. These architectures are key for predicting evolutionary responses. Pleiotropic genes that regulate multiple responses to changing seasons may facilitate coordination among functionally related traits, or conversely may constrain the expression of optimal phenotypes. Finally, we must advance our understanding of how changes in seasonal fluctuations are impacting ecological interaction networks. We should move beyond simple dyadic interactions, such as predator prey dynamics, and understand how these interactions scale up to affect ecological interaction networks. As global climate change alters many aspects of seasonal variability, including extreme events and changes in mean conditions, organisms must respond appropriately or go extinct. The outcome of adaptation to seasonality will determine responses to climate change.","tags":null,"title":"Understanding Evolutionary Impacts of Seasonality: An Introduction to the Symposium","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dieter Hiemer","Volker Salewski","Wolfgang Fiedler","Steffen Hahn","Simeon Lisovski"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1504483200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1504483200,"objectID":"f6692850bd042389f4da273c9bf9bd3b","permalink":"https://slisovski.rbind.io/publication/journal-article/hiemer_et_al_2018-jorn/","publishdate":"2017-09-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/journal-article/hiemer_et_al_2018-jorn/","section":"publication","summary":"The Blackcap Sylvia atricapilla is a model species for the evolution of bird migration in a time of global change.

With the recent development of miniaturised light-level geolocators, it is now possible to track passerines throughout the migration cycle and test these latter assumptions. We deployed 100 geolocators on Blackcaps breeding in southern Germany in 2015, and recaptured three of these birds in 2016. We used a new analytical tool implemented in the R package GeoLight to identify stopover sites during migration.

What constitutes an extreme climatic event? First we point out that extreme climatic events in biological contexts can occur in any environment. Focusing on field and laboratory data on wild birds we propose a mechanistic approach to defining and investigating what extreme climatic events are and how animals cope with them at physiological and behavioural levels. The life cycle of birds is made up of life-history stages such as migration, breeding and moult that evolved to match a range of environmental conditions an individual might expect during the year. When environmental conditions deteriorate and deviate from the expected range then the individual must trigger coping mechanisms (emergency life-history stage) that will disrupt the temporal progression of life-history stages, but enhance survival. Using the framework of allostasis, we argue that an extreme climatic event in biological contexts can be defined as when the cumulative resources available to an individual are exceeded by the sum of its energetic costs—a state called allostatic overload. This allostatic overload triggers the emergency life-history stage that temporarily allows the individual to cease regular activities in an attempt to survive extreme conditions. We propose that glucocorticoid hormones play a major role in orchestrating coping mechanisms and are critical for enduring extreme climatic events.","tags":null,"title":"How birds cope physiologically and behaviourally with extreme climatic events","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Heiko Schmaljohann","Simeon Lisovski","Franz Bairlein"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1489968000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1489968000,"objectID":"9dab7ab68d30539e09fa2167593aa914","permalink":"https://slisovski.rbind.io/publication/journal-article/schmaljohann_et_al-2017-frontzool/","publishdate":"2017-03-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/journal-article/schmaljohann_et_al-2017-frontzool/","section":"publication","summary":"Background: Predicting the consequences of continuing anthropogenic changes in the environment for migratory behaviours such as phenology remains a major challenge. Predictions remain particularly difficult, because our knowledge is based on studies from single-snapshot observations at specific stopover sites along birds’ migration routes. However, a general understanding on how birds react to prevailing environmental conditions, e.g. their ‘phenotypic reaction norm’, throughout the annual cycle and along their entire migration routes is required to fully understand how migratory birds respond to rapid environmental change.\nResults:Here, we provide direct evidence that northern wheatears (Oenanthe oenanthe) from a breeding population in Alaska adjusted their probability to resume migration as well as the distance covered per night, i.e. travel speed, to large-scale environmental conditions experienced along their 15,000 km migratory route on both northwards and southwards migrations. These adjustments were found to be flexible in space and time. At the beginning of autumn migration, northern wheatears showed high departure probabilities and high travel speeds at low surface air temperatures, while far away from Alaska both traits decreased with increasing air temperatures. In spring, northern wheatears increasingly exploited flow assistance with season, which is likely a behavioural adjustment to speed up migration by increasing the distance travelled per night. Furthermore, the variation in total stopover duration but not in travel speed had a significant effect on the total speed of migration, indicating the prime importance of total stopover duration in the overall phenology of bird migration.\nConclusion: Northern wheatears from Alaska provide evidence that the phenotypic reaction norm to a set of environmental conditions cannot be generalized to universal and persistent behavioural reaction pattern across entire migratory pathways. This highlights the importance of full annual-cycle studies on migratory birds to better understand their response to the environment. Understanding the mechanisms behind phenotypic plasticity during migration is particularly important in the assessment of whether birds can keep pace with the potentially increasing phenological mismatches observed on the breeding grounds.","tags":null,"title":"Flexible reaction norms to environmental variables along the migration route and the significance of stopover duration for total speed of migration in a songbird migrant","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Johannes Krietsch","Steffen Hahn","Matthias Kopp","Richard A.

However, despite extensive flagging and banding efforts, very little is known about the migratory strategies and the breeding grounds of this species that spends the non-breeding season mainly on the northern shorelines of Australia. Using light-level geolocators deployed on Great Knots at Roebuck Bay (Western Australia), we describe the individual migration strategies, breeding locations and breeding-related behaviour. Based on data from eight successfully tracked individuals, we found that all except one migrated to the western part of the known breeding range. This was 2,000–2,500 km from the eighth individual that commenced breeding in the potentially separated eastern part of the range. Light intensity and temperature profiles provided evidence that four of the birds successfully hatched chicks. Of the three which failed, one appeared to have laid a second clutch before failing again. Arrival at the breeding grounds and the laying of eggs were remarkably synchronous between individuals, as were the arrival dates back at Roebuck Bay. Departure from the breeding grounds was more spread out, partly dependent on breeding success and also as a result of females probably leaving the nesting area before males. The individual migration strategies confirmed the strong dependence of this species on the Yellow Sea as their major stopover site during both southward and northward migration. Furthermore, all individuals stopped at least once on their northward journey to the Yellow Sea from Australia. And in reverse, all individuals stopped at least once on the southward migration before arriving at the Yellow Sea coming from their Arctic breeding grounds. The results indicate that this species will most likely be further affected by the rapid habitat loss in the area of the Yellow Sea and other parts of the Chinese coastline.","tags":null,"title":"Tracking the full annual-cycle of the Great Knot, Calidris tenuirostris, a long-distance migratory shorebird of the East Asian-Australasian Flyway","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Simeon Lisovski","Bethany J Hoye","Marcel Klaassen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1477094400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1477094400,"objectID":"55479c03baf4bccc31cd48c352e5052d","permalink":"https://slisovski.rbind.io/publication/journal-article/lisovski_et_al-2017-oikos/","publishdate":"2016-10-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/journal-article/lisovski_et_al-2017-oikos/","section":"publication","summary":"Seasonal changes in environmental drivers – such as temperature, rainfall, and resource availability – have the potential to shape infection dynamics through their reverberating effects on biological processes including host abundance and susceptibility to infection. However, seasonality varies geographically. We therefore expect marked differences in infection dynamics between regions with different seasonal patterns. By pairing extensive Avian Influenza Virus (AIV) surveillance data – 65 358 individual bird samples from 12 species of dabbling ducks sampled at 174 locations across North America – with quantification of seasonality using remote sensed data indicative for primary productivity (normalised differenced vegetation index, NDVI), we provide evidence that seasonal dynamics influence infection dynamics across a continent. More pronounced epidemics were seen to occur in regions experiencing a higher degree of seasonality, and epidemics of lower amplitude and longer duration occurred in regions with a more protracted and lower seasonal amplitude. These results demonstrate the potential importance of geographic variation in seasonality for explaining geographic variation in the dynamics of infectious diseases in wildlife.","tags":null,"title":"Geographic variation in seasonality and its influence on the dynamics of an infectious disease","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yuichi Yamaura","Heiko Schmaljohann","Simeon Lisovski","Masayuki Senzaki","Kazuhiro Kawamura","Yuzo Fujimaki","Futoshi Nakamura"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1465948800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1465948800,"objectID":"713e4e076524b8e9b36d94b13799fd76","permalink":"https://slisovski.rbind.io/publication/journal-article/yamaura_et_al-2015-avianbiol/","publishdate":"2016-06-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/journal-article/yamaura_et_al-2015-avianbiol/","section":"publication","summary":"The East Asian–Australian Flyway spans from north Asia to Australia and is the world's richest birds' flyway because it involves  40% of global migratory bird species.

Individual stonechats spent 42–70 d en route during their autumn migration. Both the major non‐breeding grounds and the stopover sites are likely to pose challenges to the persistence of this species, because these habitats are currently degraded and will likely be lost in the near future due to intensified agriculture and the establishment of permanent croplands. Moreover, the areas used by Stejneger's stonechat during migration largely overlapped with illegal trapping areas in northeastern China.","tags":null,"title":"Tracking the Stejneger's stonechat Saxicola stejnegeri along the East Asian–Australian Flyway from Japan via China to southeast Asia","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jan A van Gils","Simeon Lisovski","Tamar Lok","Włodzimierz Meissner","Agnieszka Ożarowska","Jimmy de Fouw","Eldar Rakhimberdiev","Mikhail Y.

Here we present evidence for a case of such body shrinkage, potentially due to malnutrition in early life. We show that an avian long-distance migrant (red knot, Calidris canutus canutus), which is experiencing globally unrivaled warming rates at its high-Arctic breeding grounds, produces smaller offspring with shorter bills during summers with early snowmelt. This has consequences half a world away at their tropical wintering grounds, where shorter-billed individuals have reduced survival rates. This is associated with these molluscivores eating fewer deeply buried bivalve prey and more shallowly buried seagrass rhizomes. We suggest that seasonal migrants can experience reduced fitness at one end of their range as a result of a changing climate at the other end.","tags":null,"title":"Body shrinkage due to Arctic warming reduces red knot fitness in tropical wintering range","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Simeon Lisovski","Anne Fröhlich","Matthew von Tersch","Marcel Klaassen","Hans-Ulrich Peter","Markus S.

Surveillance of wild bird reservoirs provides an opportunity to add to the understanding of the epidemiology of AIVs.\nMethods: This study examined key findings from the National Avian Influenza Wild Bird Surveillance Program over a 5‐year period (July 2007–June 2012), the main source of information on AIVs circulating in Australia.\nResults: The overall proportion of birds that tested positive for influenza A via PCR was 1.9 ± 0.1%, with evidence of widespread exposure of Australian wild birds to most low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) subtypes (H1–13, H16). LPAI H5 subtypes were found to be dominant and widespread during this 5‐year period.\nConclusion:Given Australia's isolation, both geographically and ecologically, it is important for Australia not to assume that the epidemiology of AIV from other geographic regions applies here. Despite all previous highly pathogenic avian influenza outbreaks in Australian poultry being attributed to H7 subtypes, widespread detection of H5 subtypes in wild birds may represent an ongoing risk to the Australian poultry industry.","tags":null,"title":"Avian influenza in Australia: a summary of 5 years of wild bird surveillance","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Johannes Krietsch","Jan Esefeld","Christina Braun","Simeon Lisovski","Hans-Ulrich Peter"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1444867200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1444867200,"objectID":"e9b3f2062c4ac769ef7226eef598b7a2","permalink":"https://slisovski.rbind.io/publication/journal-article/krietsch_et_al-2016-polbiol/","publishdate":"2015-10-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/journal-article/krietsch_et_al-2016-polbiol/","section":"publication","summary":"Marine ecosystems face a variety of threats induced by environmental changes and anthropogenic activities. Seabirds are predators often used as indicator species to monitor the status and health of their communities and the environment. Here, we present the results from a 35-year monitoring time series of Brown Skuas (Catharacta antarctica lonnbergi) and South Polar Skuas (C. maccormicki) breeding sympatrically in the Maritime Antarctic on Fildes Peninsula and Potter Peninsula, King George Island. Our results reveal high annual variability in the number and proportions of breeding pairs across the entire study period. Apart from that, the breeding pair numbers of Brown Skuas were relatively stable. By contrast, the breeding pair number of mixed species and South Polar Skua pairs increased substantially until 2003/2004 and 2010/2011, respectively. Both pair types experienced a decline in the breeding pair numbers within recent years. Despite the strong fluctuations in the number of breeding pairs, the sum of occupied territories has been stable during the last 9 years. The breeding success of all pair types declined significantly, and within recent years, both South Polar Skuas and mixed species pairs completely failed to produce offspring. The ultimate causes driving the breeding success decline remain unclear. The overall increase in the number of skuas might have raised density-dependent factors and resulted in a higher predation rate between conspecifics. The more recent total breeding failures, however, indicate a drastic shortage in local food availability.","tags":null,"title":"Long-term dataset reveals declines in breeding success and high fluctuations in the number of breeding pairs in two skua species breeding on King George Island","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Silke Bauer","Simeon Lisovski","Steffen Hahn"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1444176000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1444176000,"objectID":"85753f1ccc87706253b3e4fe6f2b9936","permalink":"https://slisovski.rbind.io/publication/journal-article/bauer_et_al-2016-oikos/","publishdate":"2015-10-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/journal-article/bauer_et_al-2016-oikos/","section":"publication","summary":"Migratory connectivity can have important consequences for individuals, populations and communities. We argue that most consequences not only depend on which sites are used but importantly also on when these are used and suggest that the timing of migration is characterised by synchrony, phenology, and consistency. We illustrate the importance of these aspects of timing for shaping the consequences of migratory connectivity on individual fitness, population dynamics, gene flow and community dynamics using examples from throughout the animal kingdom.Exemplarily for one specific process that is shaped by migratory connectivity and the timing of migration – the transmission of parasites and the dynamics of diseases – we underpin our arguments with a dynamic epidemiological network model of a migratory population. Here, we quantitatively demonstrate that variations in migration phenology and synchrony yield disease dynamics that significantly differ from a time‐neglecting case. Extending the original definition of migratory connectivity into a spatio‐temporal concept can importantly contribute to understanding the links migratory animals make across the globe and the consequences these may have both for the dynamics of their populations and the communities they visit throughout their journeys.","tags":null,"title":"Timing is crucial for consequences of migratory connectivity","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Simeon Lisovski","Ken Gosbell","Maureen Christie","Bethany J.

Moving longer distances causes additional efforts in energy and time, and to be adaptive, this should be counterbalanced by favorable condition en route. We compared migration patterns of nightingales that travelled along different flyways from their European breeding sites to the African nonbreeding sites. We tested for deviations from shortest routes and related the observed and expected routes to the habitat availability at ground during autumn and spring migration. All individuals flew detours of varying extent. Detours were largest and seasonally consistent in western flyway birds, whereas birds on the central and eastern flyways showed less detours during autumn migration, but large detours during spring migration (eastern flyway birds). Neither migration durations nor the time of arrival at destination were related to the lengths of detours. Arrival at the breeding site was nearly synchronous in birds flying different detours. Flying detours increased the potential availability of suitable broad‐scale habitats en route only along the western flyway. Habitat availability on observed routes remained similar or even decreased for individuals flying detours on the central or the eastern flyway as compared to shortest routes. Thus, broad‐scale habitat distribution may partially explain detour performance, but the weak detour‐habitat association along central and eastern flyways suggests that other factors shape detour extent regionally. Prime candidate factors are the distribution of small suitable habitat patches at local scale as well as winds specific for the region and altitude.","tags":null,"title":"Variable detours in long-distance migration across ecological barriers and their relation to habitat availability at ground","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Volker Salewski","Martin Flade","Anatolii Poluda","Grzegorz Kiljan","Felix Liechti","Simeon Lisovski","Steffen Hahn"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1354320000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1354320000,"objectID":"1ff41fd231ec197180b492ee5bc00280","permalink":"https://slisovski.rbind.io/publication/journal-article/salewski_et_al-2013-jorn/","publishdate":"2012-12-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/journal-article/salewski_et_al-2013-jorn/","section":"publication","summary":"The globally-threatened Aquatic Warbler (_Acrocephalus paludicola_) breeds in Europe and spends the northern winter in sub-Saharan West Africa.
