abstract= "1. Determining global position by light measurements (‘geolocation’) has revolutionised the methods used to track migratory birds throughout their annual cycle.<br />2. To date, there is no standard way of analysing geolocator data, making communication of analyses cumbersome and hampering the reproducibility of results.<br />3. We have, therefore, developed the R package GeoLight, which provides basic functions for all steps of determining global positioning and a new approach in analysing movement pattern.<br />4. Here, we briefly introduce and discuss the major functions of this package using example movement data of European hoopoe (_Upupa epops_)."
