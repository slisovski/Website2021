abstract= "The previous discoveries of the rock bunting Emberiza cia in Jena, beginning with the by now con rmed observations by J. M. Bechstein (1795), are described. On July 13th 1996 Hahn und Reinhardt (1997) were able to record the rst breeding observation in Thuringia on a limestone slope in the Saale valley near Jena, the second evidence of nesting was found by M. ritz about 4km north of the rst observation on June 13th 1999. in 1997, 2005, 2010, 2011 (assumed breeding) and 2012 per year 1-3 rock buntings could be observed at di erent sites around Jena. in this time no nest could be found. The rock buntings living environment is located in the nature re- serve “Kernberge und Wöllmisse bei Jena” (2075 ha, altitude186-405 m a.s.l.) and is characterized by warm, south-facing, rocky limestone slopes, formerly used for wine-growing. Typical plant communities in the rock and arid habitats of the slopes are dry grasslands mainly dominated by Germander and Sesleria, as well as species-rich mesophytic grasslands dominated by brome grass. The grasslands are interrupted by small groups of diverse shrub-species. The dense shrub- communities and the lime-rubble with its many orchids at the base of the slopes provide insects and herbal food, as well as protection against increasing disturbance, e.g. recreational activities on the hiking trails, that are fragmenting the rock buntings living space. Whether the sporadic settlement 200 km away from the nearest breeding occurrence is caused due climate warming or if the species has been overlooked for many years remains unknown."
